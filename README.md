HP 41 Focal User Code Compiler & Decompiler & Barcode Generator

The HP-41 Focal User Code Compiler transforms focal user code from text form to the binary raw file format or to barcodes. The compiler reads in an ASCII source file and outputs a .raw binary file. In case of barcodes JPG files are created. Strong error checking is done during the compilation. In addition to the original HP-41 the compiler adds some features like comments and constants to structure the source file and to make it more readable and maintainable.
